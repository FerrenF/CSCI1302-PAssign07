CSCI1302-PAssign07


Task: Write a program that creates a JavaFX interface (distinctly different from the provided
example in the Github repo) using basic JavaFX components (Buttons, TextFields, Labels,
Images, ImageViews, etc.) that replicates a real-world object that has a keypad. Your program
must use the KeyPadPane provided in the Github repo. No direct changes should be made to
the KeyPadPane class but it can be extended to add additional functionality (see
KeyPadPanePlus.java as a tiny example, this would not be enough functionality to satisfy the
requirements of this assignment). Experiment with various properties/values to attempt to
recreate the real-world object.
